Day 1: (break 2:15 pm)
    1> Understanding and explanations of objectives behind Ethical Hacking
        > Security in corporate

        Key Point: Start with 'Fundamentals of network' (OSI model and architecture) (Open System Interconnection)-> guidline
            
            OSI Model
            > Application Layer (example: Chrome)
            > Application Layer Protocols (example: HTTP (port no. 80))
            > Random Ports(Port no.'s after 1024) typically used for Attacks (Trojan, Virus, etc.)
            > Data Layer
            > Presentation Layer (converting data layer to standard format)
                > Example: Binary to ASCII
                > Includes Compression, Encryption, etc.
            > Session Layer (example: login sustanance using 'session ID')
            > Transport Layer
                > Segmentation (packets)
                > Sequencing and Reassembling (indexing)
                    * UDP faster (due to no acknowledgement) than TCP
                    * TCP more reliable than UDP
                
            Key Point: WireShark
                > Error Correction (example: Checksum)
            > Network Layer
                > IP address
                > Packet size (64-1500 bytes)
            > Data Link
                > MAC address (Home router)
            > Physical
                > Converted to electronic signals (0 and 1)
